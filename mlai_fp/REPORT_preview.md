\begin{abstract}
Shortest path finding problem is widely appeared for engineering and has application in real life. To solve the shortest path problem in weighted directed graph, we explore multiple approaches, including dynamic programming, reinforcement learning (specifically Q-learning), and value function approximation. Reinforcement learning is widely used to solve problems in real life. In this report, we take use of reinforcement learning to solve shortest path problem in weighted directed graph. Q-learning method is applied and we also use value function approximation to solve the problem. Besides, dynamic programming is applied to the graph to compute the shortest path between any pair of start and end nodes. Furthermore, we try to train a model based on value function approximation such that the obtained solution can work even if you offer a different graph. The results of experiments show that we achieve good performance.

- \section{Introduction}
  
  Shortest path problem is a general problem in engineering field, which is applied in robot navigation and path planning. In this report, we provide several methods to solve shortest path problem in weighted directed graph, including dynamic programming, reinforcement learning and value function approximation. We test these method in weighted directed graphs and compare their performance. Besides, we also try to build a model based on value function approximation such that the obtained solution can work even if you offer a different graph.
